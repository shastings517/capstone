        <h4>Tweeter visualizes tweet sentiment in realtime. Get started by entering a keyword in the input box and pressing the start button (<i class="fa fa-power-off"></i>).<br><br>

        Tweeter will then start graphing the positivity/negativity of tweets about your keyword. Using a text sentiment analysis library, text sentiment is parsed from tweets about your keyword in realtime. Each tweet is assigned a score based on the words it contains; higher scores mean more instances of positive words. Tweet sentiment is represented on the y-axis and time on the x-axis. <br><br> 

        Click the circular "M" button above the graph to see where the tweets are coming from. See the color gradient at the top of the screen for scale; green represents positive, red represents negative, and yellow represents neutral sentiment. The darker the color the more positive/negative the sentiment. <br><br> 

        Click the circular "D" to see more data about the tweet stream. <br><br>
        Click the reset button (<i class="fa fa-refresh"></i>) to reset and search again.</h4>
